		<h3>Help with badges</h3>
		<hr/>
		<p>See and add badges to your account to be assigned to users.</p>
		<h4>Badge Themes</h4>
		<p>Badges in your account are displayed here. The badge id is important to note because that is how 
		badges will be assigned to users. On your server, when you want to award a badge, you must use the badge id 
		in order to specify which badge to award to the user.</p>
		<h4>Upload a badge</h4>
		<p>Use this tab to upload a badge. Set the name, theme (badges are ordered by theme), and a brief description 
		about the badge. This description should be small because it can optionally be displayed per badge
		 (you can choose what information is displayed per widget by clicking the "Features" link on the left navigation menu).</p>
    <h4>Overwrite a badge</h4>
    <p>Don't like the badge image? Use the same badge theme and name to overwrite the previous one. Be careful not to reuse the same name and theme otherwise.</p>
