		<h3>Help with features</h3>

		<p>You can edit how your widgets look and some of the text that they will display. Use the tabs to select 
		a widget that you wish to edit. Click on the edit button next to the attribute you would like to edit and 
		enter in a new value for the attribute you would like to change.</p>
		<p><b>Make sure that when you edit a string value, it is 
		valid for the attribute you edit. For example, a color value shoud not be: "$@%#", it should be "blue". 
		This will not be an issue after color pickers and drop downs are added to the widget editing tabs.</b></p>
